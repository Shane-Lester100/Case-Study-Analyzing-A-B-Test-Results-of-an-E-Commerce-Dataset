# Case Study: Analyzing A/B Test Results of an E-Commerce Dataset

A/B testing is a research methodology used to see the best user experience amongst two options. It utilizes a control group and an experimental group, making it a simple controlled experiment.

This case study focuses on testing two web page elements, an old one and a new one, for the one that leads to more click conversions. The focus is to show the utilization of probability to frame a problem, how to use hypothesis testing to either reject or fail to reject the old web page element, and how to use logistic regression modeling to see the results of how each feature relates to click-conversions. The regression model leads to even more insight into what features lead to clicks and can provide predictive power.

Also in this repository is an environment file to reproduce this analysis.
